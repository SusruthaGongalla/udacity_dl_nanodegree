This repo contains code submitted for completing projects as part of udacity deep learning nanodegree. Following technologies were used in each of the projects:
* `dog-breed-classifier`: Train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the breed of the dog in a given image
* `tv-script-generation`: Train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to learn from a given script and generate a new script similar to the training script
* `face-generation`: Train a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) to learn from face images and generate new images resembling human faces
* `teach-quadcopter-to-fly`: Train a Reinforcement Learning model to teach a quadcopter to fly by interacting with its environment
